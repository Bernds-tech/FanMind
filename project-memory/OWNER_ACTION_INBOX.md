# FanMind Owner Action Inbox

This is the single compact queue for actions that genuinely require the owner, an external provider, protected UI access, payment authorization, legal/tax evidence or another capability unavailable to the assistant.

## FM-RST-OWNER-001 — Restore runner-group policy + host readiness
- Status: COMPLETED
- Where: GitHub Organization `FanMind` -> Settings -> Actions -> Runner groups -> `fanmind-restore-drill`
- Result: selected repository/workflow policy, Host-1 and Host-2 were revalidated for protected read-only run `32582640853`; all three jobs succeeded and both one-job runners cleaned up.
- Risk: R4
- Duration class: short
- Evidence: run `32582640853`, jobs `97054217701`/`97054234003`/`97054248185`, runner IDs `41`/`42`, issue #944 and controller cleanup output.
- Revalidation: this mutable evidence expires and must be repeated immediately before the later protected R4 write.

## FM-RST-OWNER-002 — Exact isolated database-Restore authorization
- Status: DEFERRED_BY_OWNER
- Where: GitHub workflow `restore-drill-database.yml`, protected `restore-drill` environment and fresh one-job JIT controller.
- Why: the state machine is `TARGET_COMPATIBLE`; the next transition writes to the isolated database and is outside read-only standing authorization.
- Risk: R4
- Duration class: protected execution block
- Resume trigger: owner grants a new exact authorization naming commit, accepted Full Backup/source binding, isolated target, workflow confirmation and two fresh sequential one-job JITs.
- Do not ask before: explicit owner resume. Never infer this authorization from the successful read-only run.

## FM-GOV-OWNER-001 — Protect `main`
- Status: DEFERRED_BY_OWNER
- Where: GitHub repository/organization Rulesets or Branch Protection UI
- Why: `main` should require PRs/checks and block force-push/delete/direct routine pushes.
- Risk: R3
- Duration class: short
- Resume trigger: owner chooses to complete GitHub governance setup.
- Do not ask before: explicit owner resume.

## Rules
- `DEFERRED_BY_OWNER` means keep visible but do not repeatedly interrupt the owner.
- When an action is completed in another chat/session, reconcile GitHub/Project Memory evidence first, then mark it done here.
- Never infer provider, payment, signing, destructive, legal or protected Production acceptance from code or chat text alone.
